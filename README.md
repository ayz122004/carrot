# Carrot
Carrot and stick, but just the carrot.

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project was the epidemic of demotivation that swept the world right alongside COVID-19. For us, the past school year was largely characterized by grades fast-dropping and stress fast-rising. As we brainstormed ideas for this project, we asked ourselves: what could we have done to keep our work ethic strong this past year? Our answer was Carrot: a reward-based task management app.

## What it does
At its core, Carrot is a basic productivity app. It keeps track of tasks to do and tasks completed (based on what the user inputs), and it also displays some statistics derived from that data. However, we wanted to focus a bit more on the reward-based aspect of the app. After finishing a task, the user can swipe on its name so that it disappears from the main task page and reappears on the rewards pageâ€”this time, with a little bit of a change. Instead of displaying the task name and task description, the rewards page displays the reward name and reward description. The name and description come from what the user input while creating the task.

## How we built it
Carrot was built using Dart and Flutter. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This was the first complete mobile app that we built.

## What we learned
- State management (using Provider)
- Learned to use git/github version control
- Furthered our UI development skills in Flutter

## What's next for Carrot
We hope to develop Carrot further to enhance user experience and app functionality. A more aesthetic UI and a local storage system are two of the main things that we would like to add, should we choose to continue working on this project.
